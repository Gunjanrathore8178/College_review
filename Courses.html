          <p>Btech in Artificial Intelligence or Bachelors of technology in Artificial Intelligence is a 4-year undergraduate degree program, offered under a non-medical stream. The main goal of Artificial Intelligence is to program computers to use example data or experience to solve a given problem. The students are taught different languages used in computer science through which a human can interact with them for performing various tasks. Some common languages like HTML, python, java, prologue are studied in the Btech degree.</p>

          <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is any technique that enables computers to mimic human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches to build smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. Data Science (DS) is an umbrella term for a group of fields that are used to analyze large datasets. It is the field of study that combines domain expertise, programming skills, and knowledge of mathematics and statistics to extract meaningful insights from data. Data Science is a comprehensive process that involves pre-processing, analysis, visualization and prediction. On the other hand, AI is the implementation of a predictive model to forecast future events. Data Science comprises of various statistical techniques whereas AI makes use of computer algorithms. With Data Science, we build models that use statistical insights. On the other hand, AI is for building models that emulate cognition and human understanding. Data Science does not involve a high degree of scientific processing as compared to AI. Blend of AI & DS allows the students to get best of both worlds.</p>

          <p>Computer Science Engineering (CSE) encompasses a variety of topics that relates to computation, like analysis of algorithms, programming languages, program design, software, and computer hardware.  Computer Science engineering has roots in electrical engineering, mathematics, and linguistics. In the past Computer Science was taught as part of mathematics or engineering departments & in the recent days it has emerged as a separate engineering field. It does Design and develop software application for different industries, Manages the software, hardware & networks in any industry, Involves in the design and development of the hardware components of PCs & laptops, Develop software for peripheral computing devices such as printers, modems and scanners and Writes code and algorithms for operating systems like Windows, Linux etc.</p>

              The phrase “information technology” goes back to a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review (HBR). Authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler defined several types of information technology &#58;
              <ul class="it-list">
                <li>Techniques for the fast processing of information</li>
                <li>The use of statistical and mathematical models for decision-making</li>
                <li>The “simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs”</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

        <p class="img-with-cont">“While many aspects of this technology are uncertain, it seems clear that it will move into the managerial scene rapidly, with definite and far-reaching impact on managerial organization,” they wrote. Six decades later, it&#8217;s clear that Leavitt and Whisler were onto something big. Today, information technology refers to everything that businesses use computers for. Information technology is building communications networks for a company, safeguarding data and information, creating and administering databases, helping employees troubleshoot problems with their computers or mobile devices, or doing a range of other work to ensure the efficiency and security of business information systems.</p>

          <img class="course-heading-image" src="ece.png"/>
          <p>Electronics & Communication Engineering deals with the electronic devices, circuits, communication equipments like transmitter, receiver, integrated circuits (IC). It also deals with basic electronics, analog and digital transmission & reception of data, voice and video (Example AM, FM, DTH), microprocessors, satellite communication, microwave engineering, antennae and wave progression. It aims to deepen the knowledge and skills of the students on the basic concepts and theories that will equip them in their professional work involving analysis, systems implementation, operation, production, and maintenance of the various applications in the field of Electronics and Communications Engineering.</p>

        <div class="img-with-cont">
          <img class="course-heading-image" src="Civil-Engineering.png"/>
          <p>Civil engineering is the application of physical and scientific principles for the design, development and maintenance of both the constructed and the naturally built environment. This includes infrastructure such as airports, bridges, buildings, canals, dams, pipelines, power plants, railways, roads, sewage systems, and more. Civil engineering projects can come through the public sector, from government agencies, or through the private sector, and can be either large or small in scale, with civil engineers working in fields such as planning, budgeting, project and asset management, research, analysis, and more.</p>

          <img class="course-heading-image" src="mechanical_lead.jpg"/>
          <p>Technically, mechanical engineering is the application of the principles and problem-solving techniques of engineering from design to manufacturing to the marketplace for any object. Mechanical engineers analyze their work using the principles of motion, energy, and force—ensuring that designs function safely, efficiently, and reliably, all at a competitive cost. Mechanical engineers make a difference. That's because mechanical engineering careers center on creating technologies to meet human needs. Virtually every product or service in modern life has probably been touched in some way by a mechanical engineer to help humankind. This includes solving today's problems and creating future solutions in health care, energy, transportation, world hunger, space exploration, climate change, and more.</p>
