          <br>
          <br>
          <h2><b>=>ATTEND COMPANY’S PRESENTATION TALK</b></h2>
          <p style="font-size: 24px;">This is the first and foremost thing to do during campus placement drive. You should never miss Company’s pre-placement talks and presentations. The reason you attend these sessions because most of the times questions in HR interview are asked directly from what was conveyed during company’s pre-placement talk during campus placement drive. It gives you a background of what company is doing, domain in which company is working and most important, technology that company is working on. This helps you in identifying if this is the right company for you.  </p>
          <br>
          <img src="https://adgitmdelhi.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/comp_pres_talk.jpg">
          <br>
          <br>
          <p style="font-size: 24px;">You should note down the points that are being conveyed during the presentation such as Annual Turn Over of the company, details about CEO and other important people in Company and their employee strength, locations and product details. Never show a disinterest to the points that are conveyed during introduction sessions in placement drive. In case there is no pre placement presentation it is highly recommended that one should do research regarding the organization’s profile and see their profile in internet.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2><b>=>PREPARE A FRESH CURRICULUM VITAE (CV)</b></h2>

          <br>
          <br>
          <p style="font-size: 24px;">Keep your Curriculum Vitae (CV) and other important documents in a professional document folder. You can carry two three copies of CV with yourself and never make a mistake of showing a Xerox copy of your CV during campus placement drive. Carry extra copies of all documents and have extra photographs as well. You must have read your CV thoroughly before sitting in placement drive.</p>
          <br>
          <br>

          <br>
          <br>

Sit with a positive gesture and a confident smile on your face. It is important to be heard by your interviewer, so speak in a clean and firm voice but don’t shout on and cross question the interviewer. Make sure you never indulge in any type of argument with the interviewer or any company official in campus placement drive. Also keep an eye contact with the interviewer but don’t overdo it. Try not to give a wrong answer to any question that you don’t know about and never enquire about the salary details until initiated by interviewer.

Once the interview comes to an end, thank the interviewer and place the chair back to the original position making sure it’s done without any noise.</p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <h2><b>=>HUMAN RESOURCE (HR) INTERVIEW</b></h2>
          <p style="font-size: 24px;">HR Interviews can be a source of stress and anxiety when you are looking for a job.

          <img src="https://az505806.vo.msecnd.net/cms/283caf54-4115-4b73-830c-9a3e2eed0bdb/c2e16c13-5c79-4e93-9899-e96908f7c476-lg.jpg">
          <br>
          <br>
          <p style="font-size: 24px;">All interviews are not the same and HR interviews are often times a screening process that can earn you a follow-up or selection interview within the company. If an individual passes the selection interview, he may be required to participate in a group interview for final analysis. The key to success in HR interviews is to be yourself while respecting your employer. Always highlight yours strengths in HR interview and do not talk of weaknesses. Never show your faults, and never share regret with an interviewer.</p>
